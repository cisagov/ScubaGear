## Run ScubaGear Feature

The integrated ScubaGear execution feature allows you to run assessments directly from the UI without manual command-line operations.

### Execution Process

1. **Pre-Execution Validation**: The UI validates your configuration before starting
2. **ScubaGear Invocation**: Automatically calls `Invoke-SCuBA` with your settings
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time output display with status updates
4. **Completion Handling**: Automatic report loading and tab generation
5. **Error Management**: Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirements for Execution

- _Initialize-Scuba_ has been ran to ensure all modules and dependencies are installed
- Valid configuration with at least one product selected
- Appropriate Microsoft Graph permissions for your account
- Network connectivity to Microsoft 365 services

### Output Monitoring

During execution, you'll see:
- Product assessment progress (e.g., "Assessing Entra ID policies...")
- Policy evaluation status
- Authentication confirmations (if running in interactive mode)
- Report generation progress
- Completion notifications or error messages

## Report Summary Feature

The native WPF report viewer provides a modern, integrated experience for reviewing ScubaGear assessment results.

### Status Badge System

Each policy displays a colored status badge indicating compliance level:

| Badge Color | Status | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Green** | Pass | Policy meets compliance requirements |
| **Yellow** | Warning | Policy needs attention or has minor issues |
| **Red** | Failure | Policy fails compliance requirements |
| **Blue** | Manual | Policy requires manual review or verification |
| **Gray** | Error/N/A | Policy has errors or is not implemented |

### Report Navigation

- **Product Tabs**: Click between different product assessments (AAD, Exchange, etc.)
- **Policy Details**: Click on individual policies for detailed findings
- **Status Filtering**: Visual scanning using color-coded badges
- **Scroll Optimization**: Compact layout minimizes scrolling requirements

## Integration with ScubaGear

The configurations created by this UI are fully compatible with the main ScubaGear assessment tool:

```powershell
# Use the generated configuration
Invoke-SCuBA -ConfigFilePath "path\to\generated\example.onmicrosoft.com.yaml"
```

## Module Files

### Core Files

- **SCuBAConfig.psm1**: Main module file containing all functions and UI logic
- **SCuBAConfig.psd1**: Module manifest with metadata and dependencies
- **ScubaConfigApp.xaml**: WPF UI definition file

### Configuration Files

- **ScubaConfigApp_Control_en-US.json**: English localization and configuration settings
- Additional language files can be added following the same naming pattern

## Requirements

- **PowerShell 5.1** or later
- **.NET Framework 4.5** or later
- **Windows OS** with WPF support
- **ScubaGear Module** (parent module)

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Configuration

Use debug window to get detailed information about:

- UI events and user interactions
- Configuration validation results
- Import/export operations
- Graph API calls and responses

#### Enabling Debug Mode

This is enabled by default. However if your not seeing the debug button, follow these steps:

1. Edit `ScubaConfigApp\ScubaConfigApp_Control_en-US.json` in the module directory.
2. Change `"DebugMode": true` to enable.
3. Restart the UI application. There will be a debug button in the bottom right corner.

Example:
```json
{
  "DebugMode": true,
  ...
}
```

The **Debug Window** displays detailed diagnostic information, but it is **not intended** for end users to troubleshoot issues on their own.
Instead, it is recommended to:

- Open an [bug](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/issues/new?template=2-bugreport.yaml)
- Export the log from the debug window (Santize it if needed)
- Explain the issue and attach the debug log to bug issue

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A **Sanitize** option is available to replace sensitive data with placeholder values.

![ScubaGear Debug Window](../images/scubaconfigapp_debug.png)

### Common Issues

- **UI won't launch**: Check PowerShell execution policy. Use `-Passthru` parameter to output error:

  ```powershell
  # Basic usage - Launch the configuration UI
  $SCuBAUI = Start-SCuBAConfigApp -Passthru
  $SCuBAUI.error
  ```

- **Graph connectivity fails**: Verify the `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` module is installed and your authentication credentials have Graph permissions. You must have the following Graph permissions:

  ```
  User.Read.All
  Group.Read.All
  Organization.Read.All
  Application.Read.All
  ```

- **Configuration validation errors**: Review required fields and format requirements. Be sure to click `Save` for each configuration and then the click `Preview & Generate` button.



## Issues / Troubleshooting / Workarounds

- Clicking between `New Session` and `Import` multiple times may cause UI issues. Close UI and relaunch is the recommended
- The UI does not support YAML anchors or aliases at this time. Use `-Online` parameter to help build exclusions
- The UI does not support JSON export at this time.
- The `-Online` parameter does not support using a service principal at this time when running the UI; it must be interactive. A service principal can be configured within the UI (see Advanced Section) and will be used to ScubaGear within UI.
- If no baselines are showing after selecting product names, it could be a communication issue with the GitHub repository. Change `PullOnlineBaselines` to `false` within the `ScubaConfigApp_Control_en-US.json` app configuration file

### Run ScubaGear and Report Summary Notes

- **Report tabs**: Report tabs are dynamically generated based on assessment results. If no results are found for a product, no tab will be created.
- **Execution monitoring**: ScubaGear execution runs in a background process. Closing the UI during execution will terminate the assessment.
- **Report refresh**: To view updated reports after making configuration changes, you must re-run the ScubaGear assessment.
- **Native report viewer**: The WPF report viewer replaces web browser controls and may display differently than the standard HTML reports generated by ScubaGear.

## Development

### Adding Localization

1. Create new configuration file following naming pattern: `ScubaConfigApp_Control_<locale>.json`
2. Translate all text elements in the localeContext section
3. Create new baseline configuration file following naming pattern: `ScubaBaselines_<locale>.json`
4. Translate text elements: _name, rationale_ for each baseline item
5. Set `PullOnlineBaselines:false` within the `ScubaConfigApp_Control_en-US.json` app configuration file
6. Update root module (`ScubaConfigApp.psm1`) to support new locale.
