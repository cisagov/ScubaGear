# Non-interactive Permissions

Running ScubaGear in a non-interactive (automated) fashion requires an application with a service principal identity that has been assigned various permissions and roles, depending upon which M365 products are being tested, and associated with a certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> While there are many ways to authenticate with a service principal, ScubaGear only authenticates via a certificate identified by its certificate thumbprint.

## Overview

These are the following steps that must be completed:

* Create a service principal
* Create a certificate
* Associate the certificate with the service principal
* Determining the thumbprint of the certificate

## Service Principal

Configuring a service principal is beyond the scope of these instructions, but Microsoft has documentation that may help:

* [Create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) in the Azure console.
* Associate a [certificate with a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-3)

> [!NOTE]
> Take note of the AppId and the name of your tenant, as these values will be required to execute ScubaGear in non-interactive mode.

The minimum permissions and roles that must be assigned to the service principal are listed in the table below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Permissions that have "write" privileges are included in the [Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal#limitations-of-service-principals) and [SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-selected-overview?tabs=http#what-permissions-do-i-need-to-manage-permissions) permissions list below. Those permissions are the minimum required by ScubaGear to be able to read admin center configurations for those two services and is a limitation of the underlying APIs of these services. ScubaGear itself **does not exercise the use of the write privileges** for its assessments.

> [!NOTE]
> Additional details necessary for GCC High non-interactive authentication are detailed in [this section](#additional-gcc-high-details) below.<sup>1</sup>

## Certificate Thumbprint

Microsoft has documentation that shows how to get the [thumbprint of a certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-how-to-add-certificate?tabs=http#prerequisites) using PowerShell.

Once the service principal and certificate thumbprint have been created, ScubaGear's [dependencies](dependencies.md) can be installed.

## Power Platform

Power Platform requires additional, one-time setup.

### Registration

The application associated with the service principal must be [manually registered](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal#registering-an-admin-management-application) to Power Platform via interactive authentication with an administrative account before ScubaGear is executed. Microsoft explains the [limitations of service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powershell-create-service-principal#limitations-of-service-principals) with Power Platform.

To register the service principal, execute these commands:

```powershell
# Login interactively with a tenant admin for Power Platform
Add-PowerAppsAccount `
  -Endpoint prod `
  -TenantID 22f22c70-de09-4d21-b82f-af8ad73391d9
```

> [!NOTE]
> When testing [GCC tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc), use `-Endpoint usgov`.

```powershell
# Register the service principal, giving it the
# same permissions as a tenant admin
New-PowerAppManagementApp -ApplicationId abcdef0123456789abcde01234566789
```

> [!NOTE]
> These commands must be run from an account with the Power Platform Administrator or Global Administrator roles.

## Certificate Location

It's helpful to note the following details:

* Power Platform has a [hardcoded expectation](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft365DSC/issues/2781) that the certificate is located in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My`.

* [MS Graph has an expectation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/authentication-commands?view=graph-powershell-1.0#use-client-credential-with-a-certificate) that the certificate is located either in the client's `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` or `Cert:\LocalMachine\My` certificate stores.

## Additional GCC High details

This section contains additional, non-interactive authentication details that are required to successfully run ScubaGear against a GCC High tenant.


### Defender in GCC High

When running ScubaGear to assess Defender for Office 365 in a GCC High tenant, the `Exchange.ManageAsApp` must be added as an application permission from both the `Microsoft Exchange Online Protection` and the `Office 365 Exchange Online`  APIs. This is mentioned in a GCC High application manifest writer's note in this section of the [Exchange Online App Only Auth MS Learn documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#modify-the-app-manifest-to-assign-api-permissions).


### SharePoint in GCC High

When running ScubaGear to assess SharePoint Online in a GCC High tenant, the `Sites.FullControl.All` application permission must be added from the GCC High-unique `Office 365 SharePoint Online` API rather than the commercial-unique `SharePoint` API located in commercial/government community cloud tenants.
