However, note that SPF allows you to [include](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-5.2) the IP addresses indicated by a separate SPF policy, referred to by domain name. See [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf) for inclusions required for M365 to send email on behalf of your domain.\n\nSPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via\nDNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed\nto set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) \\| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online) for more details.\n\nTo test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as\nthose listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? \\| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain).\nAdditionally, SPF records can be requested using the\nPowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:\n\n```\nResolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt\n```\n\nIf SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`\nreturned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF\npolicy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates\nthe IP addresses listed by the policy for \"spf.protection.outlook.com\" are\nthe only approved senders for \"example.onmicrosoft.com.\" These IPs can be determined\nvia an additional SPF lookup, this time for \"spf.protection.outlook.com.\" Ensure the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domains are correct. Additionally, ensure that each policy either ends in `-all` or [redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-6.1) to one that does; this directive indicates that all IPs that don't match the policy should fail.

Additionally, DMARC records can be requested using the\nPowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:\n\n```\nResolve-DnsName _dmarc.example.com txt\n```\n\nIf DMARC is configured, a response resembling `v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov, mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:reports@example.com`\nwill be returned, though by necessity, the contents of the record will vary\nby agency.

For example, custom meeting policies can be configured with _specific_ users having\npermission to record meetings. To allow specific users the ability to\nrecord meetings:\n\n1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Teams admin center**.\n\n2.  Select **Meetings** > **Meeting policies**.\n\n3.  Create a new policy by selecting **Add**. Give this new policy a\n    name and appropriate description.\n\n4.  Under the **Recording & transcription** section, set **Cloud\n    recording** to **On**.\n\n5.  Select **Save**.\n\n6.  After selecting **Save**, a table displays the set of policies.\n    Select the row containing the new policy, then select **Manage\n    users**.\n\n7.  Assign the users who need the ability to record to this policy.\n\n8.  Select **Apply**.\n\n**`TLP:CLEAR`**",
