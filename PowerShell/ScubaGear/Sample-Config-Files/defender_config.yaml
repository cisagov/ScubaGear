  SCuBAGear YAML Configuration file with custom variables
  This configuration shows a standard SCuBAGear set of parameters to run
  but also includes examples of custom variables for use and reference
  in Rego policy assessments against the Defender baseline.  Using
  policy-specific variables to define sensitive users, groups, and domains.
  Defender preset security policies will then be assessed to ensure sensitive
  accounts, as specified by matching policy assignment filters, are included according to the Defender baseline policy.
  Any account or domain designated as sensitive should be carefully
  considered and documented as part of an organization's cybersecurity risk
  management program process and practices.
  This example includes the following design choices for illustrative purposes:
  - Use of Pascal case convention for variable names
  - Defines a namespace for values to be used across baselines/products (i.e., GlobalVars)
  - Per product namespace for values related to that specific product (i.e., Defender, SharePoint)
  - Namespace for each policy item within a product for variables related only to one policy item (i.e., Defender.MS.DEFENDER.1.4v1)
  - Use of YAML anchors and aliases following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for repeated values and sections
