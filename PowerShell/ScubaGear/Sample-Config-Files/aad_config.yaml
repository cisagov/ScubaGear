  SCuBAGear YAML Configuration file with custom variables
  This configuration shows a standard SCuBAGear set of parameters to run
  but also includes examples of custom variables for use and reference
  in Rego policy assessments against the AAD baseline.  Specifically, using
  policy specific variables to exempt specific user and group exclusions from
  conditional access policy checks that normally would not pass if exclusions
  are present.  These parameters support operational use cases for having
  backup or break glass account exclusions to global user policies without
  failing best practices.  Any exemptions and their risks should be carefully
  considered and documented as part of an organization's cybersecurity risk
  management program process and practices.
  This example includes the following design choices for illustrative purposes:
  - Use of Pascal case convention for varible names
  - Defines a namespace for values to be used across baselines/products (i.e., GlobalVars)
  - Per product namespace for values related to that specific product (i.e., Aad, SharePoint)
  - Namespace for each policy item within a product for variables related only to one policy item (i.e., Aad.Policy2_1)
  - Use of YAML anchors and aliases following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for repeated values and sections
