# =============================
# ANNOTATE SECTION : ANNOTATE POLICIES
# =============================
# The AnnotatePolicy field can be used to add annotations or comments to specific policies
# in the SCuBA assessment results. This allows organizations to document the rationale,
# implementation details, or other relevant information about how specific controls are met.
# For in depth details, See https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/blob/main/docs/configuration/configuration.md#annotate-policies
# Note: This section is used to add contextual information to policies without affecting
#       the assessment results. The policies listed here will still be included in the
#       assessment with the additional annotation displayed in the report.

# Reasons for using Annotate Policies
# -----------------------------------
# - Provide context about implementation decisions or risk acceptance.
# - Add references to supporting documentation or evidence.
# - Explain compensating controls or mitigating factors.
# - Note planned improvements or future implementation details.
AnnotatePolicy:
  # -------------------------------------
  # ANNOTATE POLICY : AAD SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # Users detected as high risk SHALL be blocked.
  MS.AAD.2.1v1:
    Comment: "This policy is used to block users detected as high risk. The organization has a process in place to review and unblock users if necessary."
    RemediationDate: 2026-01-01  # Optional. The date a failing control is anticipated to be implemented.
  # Phishing-resistant MFA SHALL be enforced for all users.
  MS.AAD.3.1v1:
    Comment: Implementation in progress.
    RemediationDate: 2025-12-01
  # -------------------------------------
  # ANNOTATEPOLICY : EXO SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # An SPF policy SHALL be published for each domain that fails all non-approved senders.
  MS.EXO.2.2v2:
    IncorrectResult: true # use this to mark the result incorrect.
    Comment: "Known incorrect result; our SPF policy currently cannot to be retrieved via ScubaGear due to a split
      horizon setup but is available publicly."

# ============================
# OMIT SECTION : OMIT POLICIES
# ============================
# The OmitPolicy field can be used to exclude policies from the SCuBA assessment
# results (e.g., for controls that are met using a third party tool).
# For in depth details, See https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/blob/main/docs/configuration/configuration.md#omit-policies
# Note:  This section is used to omit policies from the assessment from any product.
#       The policies listed here will not be included in the assessment results.
#       You must provide a rationale for each omitted policy.

# Reasons for using Omit Policies
# --------------------------------
# - The policy is not applicable to the organization's environment.
# - The policy is met using a third-party tool or solution that is not assessed by ScubaGear.
# - The policy is an acceptable risk that has been documented and approved by the organization.
OmitPolicy:

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : AAD SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # Activation of the Global Administrator role SHALL require approval.
  MS.AAD.7.6v1:
    Rationale: "The approval process for the Global Administrator role is not acceptable to organization."

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : EXO SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # SMTP AUTH SHALL be disabled.
  MS.EXO.5.1v1:
    Rationale: "The organization has determined that SMTP AUTH is still used for onpremis applications and is needed. Will review in the future."
    Expiration: "2026-12-31"

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : TEAMS SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # A DLP solution SHALL be enabled. The selected DLP solution SHOULD offer services comparable to the native DLP solution offered by Microsoft.
  MS.TEAMS.6.1v1:
    Rationale: &DLPRationale "The DLP capability required for Teams is implemented by third party product, [x],
      which ScubaGear does not have the ability to check."

  # The DLP solution SHALL protect personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive information, as defined by the agency. At a minimum, sharing of credit card numbers, taxpayer identification numbers (TINs), and Social Security numbers (SSNs) via email SHALL be restricted.
  MS.TEAMS.6.2v1:
    Rationale: *DLPRationale

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : POWERPLATFORM SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # Non-default environments SHOULD have at least one DLP policy affecting them.
  MS.POWERPLATFORM.2.2v1:
    Rationale: *DLPRationale

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : SHAREPOINT SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # Reauthentication days for people who use a verification code SHALL be set to 30 days or less.
  MS.SHAREPOINT.3.3v1:
    Rationale: "The re-authentication days for people who use a verification code is set to 90 days, which is acceptable
      to the organization. This policy is not applicable to our environment."
    Expiration: 2026-01-03

  # -------------------------------------
  # OMIT POLICY : DEFENDER SAMPLE
  # -------------------------------------
  # User impersonation protection SHOULD be enabled for sensitive accounts in both the standard and strict preset policies.
  MS.DEFENDER.2.1v1:
    Rationale: "The user impersonation protection is not applicable to our environment. Our organization does not have any sensitive users
      defined in the standard or strict preset policies."

  # A list of apps that are restricted from accessing files protected by DLP policy SHOULD be defined.
  MS.DEFENDER.4.5v1:
    Rationale: *DLPRationale


# Use this parameter to control what DNS resolver is used to fetch the SPF,
# DKIM, and DMARC records.
PreferredDnsResolvers:
  - 8.8.8.8

# over DoH (using Cloudflare).
