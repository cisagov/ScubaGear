# CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Exchange Online

Microsoft 365 (M365) Exchange Online is a cloud-based messaging platform that gives users easy access to their email and supports organizational meetings, contacts, and calendars. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Exchange Online security.

Many admin controls for Exchange Online are found in the **Exchange admin center**.
However, several of the security features for Exchange Online are shared between Microsoft
products and are configured in either the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**
or **Microsoft Purview compliance portal**. Generally
speaking, the use of Microsoft Defender is not strictly required for
this baseline. When noted, alternative products may be used in lieu of
Defender, on the condition that they fulfill these required baseline
settings.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies’ cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for M365 help secure federal information assets stored within M365 cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government’s threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. While use of these baselines will be mandatory for civilian Federal Government agencies, organizations outside of the Federal Government may also find these baselines to be useful references to help reduce risks.

For non-Federal users, the information in this document is being provided “as is” for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CISA does not endorse any commercial product or service, including any subjects of analysis. Any reference to specific commercial entities or commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoritism by CISA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, some controls and settings are not available in all products; CISA has no control over vendor changes to products offerings or features.  Accordingly, these SCuBA SCBs for M365 may not be applicable to the products available to you.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Automatic Forwarding to External Domains

This control is intended to prevent bad actors from using client-side
forwarding rules to exfiltrate data to external recipients.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.1.1v1
Automatic forwarding to external domains SHALL be disabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.1.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Adversaries can use automatic forwarding to gain
persistent access to a victim's email. Disabling forwarding to
external domains prevents this technique when the adversary is
external to the organization but does not impede legitimate
internal forwarding.

### License Requirements

- N/A

### Implementation

#### MS.EXO.1.1v1 Instructions
To disallow automatic forwarding to external domains:

1.  Sign in to the **Exchange admin center**.

2.  Select **Mail flow**, then **Remote domains**.

3.  Select **Default**.

4.  Under **Email reply types**, select **Edit reply types**.

5.  Clear the checkbox next to **Allow automatic forwarding**, then
    click **Save**.

6.  Return to **Remote domains** and repeat steps 4 and 5 for each
    additional remote domain in the list.

## 2. Sender Policy Framework

The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a mechanism allowing domain
administrators to specify which IP addresses are explicitly approved to
send email on behalf of the domain, facilitating detection of spoofed
emails. SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but
rather via Domain Name System (DNS) records hosted by the agency's
domain. Thus, the exact steps needed to set up SPF vary from agency to
agency, but Microsoft's documentation provides some helpful starting
points.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.2.2v2
An SPF policy SHALL be published for each domain that fails all non-approved senders.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.2.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ An adversary may modify the `FROM` field
of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an
agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Publishing an SPF policy for each agency domain mitigates forged `FROM` fields by providing a means for recipients to detect emails spoofed in this way.  SPF is required for FCEB departments and agencies by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01, "Enhance Email and Web Security".
- _Last modified:_ March 2024
- _Note:_ SPF defines two different "fail" mechanisms: fail (indicated by `-`, sometimes referred to as hardfail) and softfail (indicated by `~`). Fail, as used in this baseline policy, refers to hardfail (i.e., `-`).

### License Requirements

- N/A

### Implementation

#### MS.EXO.2.2v2 Instructions
First, identify any approved senders specific to your agency, e.g., any on-premises mail servers. SPF allows you to indicate approved senders by IP address or CIDR range. However, note that SPF allows you to [include](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-5.2) the IP addresses indicated by a separate SPF policy, referred to by domain name. See [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf) for inclusions required for M365 to send email on behalf of your domain.

SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via
DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed
to set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online) for more details.

To test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as
those listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain).
Additionally, SPF records can be requested using the
PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:

```
Resolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt
```

If SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`
returned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF
policy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates
the IP addresses listed by the policy for "spf.protection.outlook.com" are
the only approved senders for "example.onmicrosoft.com." These IPs can be determined
via an additional SPF lookup, this time for "spf.protection.outlook.com." Ensure the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domains are correct. Additionally, ensure that each policy either ends in `-all` or [redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-6.1) to one that does; this directive indicates that all IPs that don't match the policy should fail. See [SPF TXT record syntax for Microsoft 365 \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-anti-spoofing?view=o365-worldwide#spf-txt-record-syntax-for-microsoft-365) for a more in-depth discussion
of SPF record syntax.

## 3. DomainKeys Identified Mail

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows digital signatures to be added
to email messages in the message header, providing a layer of both
authenticity and integrity to emails. As with SPF, DKIM relies on DNS
records; thus, its deployment depends on how an agency manages its DNS.
Exchange Online Protection (EOP) features include DKIM signing capabilities.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.3.1v1
DKIM SHOULD be enabled for all domains.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.3.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ An adversary may modify the `FROM` field
of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an
agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Enabling DKIM is another means for
recipients to detect spoofed emails and verify the integrity of email content.

## 4. Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
works with SPF and DKIM to authenticate mail senders and helps ensure
destination email systems can validate messages sent from your domain.
DMARC helps receiving mail systems determine what to do with messages
sent from your domain that fail SPF and DKIM checks.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.4.1v1
A DMARC policy SHALL be published for every second-level domain.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.4.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Without a DMARC policy available for each domain, recipients
may improperly handle SPF and DKIM failures, possibly enabling spoofed
emails to reach end users' mailboxes. Publishing DMARC records at the
second-level domain protects the second-level domains and all subdomains.

  - [T1566: Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)

#### MS.EXO.4.2v1
The DMARC message rejection option SHALL be p=reject.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.4.2v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Of the three policy options (i.e., none, quarantine, and reject),
reject provides the strongest protection. Reject is the level of protection
required by BOD 18-01 for FCEB departments and agencies.

#### MS.EXO.4.3v1
The DMARC point of contact for aggregate reports SHALL include `reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov`.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.4.3v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Email spoofing attempts are not inherently visible to domain
owners. DMARC provides a mechanism to receive reports of spoofing attempts.
Including <reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov> as a point of contact for these reports gives CISA insight into spoofing attempts and is required by BOD 18-01 for FCEB departments and agencies.

### License Requirements

- N/A

### Implementation

#### MS.EXO.4.1v1 Instructions
DMARC is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via
DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. As such, implementation varies
depending on how an agency manages its DNS records. See [Form the DMARC TXT record for your domain \| Microsoft
Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dmarc-configure?view=o365-worldwide#step-4-form-the-dmarc-txt-record-for-your-domain)
for Microsoft guidance.

A DMARC record published at the second-level domain will protect all subdomains.
In other words, a DMARC record published for `example.com` will protect both
`a.example.com` and `b.example.com`, but a separate record would need to be
published for `c.example.gov`.

To test your DMARC configuration, consider using one of many publicly available
web-based tools. Additionally, DMARC records can be requested using the
PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:

```
Resolve-DnsName _dmarc.example.com txt
```

If DMARC is configured, a response resembling `v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov, mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:reports@example.com`
will be returned, though by necessity, the contents of the record will vary
by agency. In this example, the policy indicates all emails failing the
SPF/DKIM checks are to be rejected and aggregate reports sent to
reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov and reports@example.com. Failure reports will be
sent to reports@example.com.

#### MS.EXO.4.2v1 Instructions
See [MS.EXO.4.1v1 Instructions](#msexo41v1-instructions) for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes `p=reject`.

#### MS.EXO.4.3v1 Instructions
See [MS.EXO.4.1v1 Instructions](#msexo41v1-instructions) for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes <reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov>
as one of the emails for the RUA field.

#### MS.EXO.4.4v1 Instructions
See [MS.EXO.4.1v1 Instructions](#msexo41v1-instructions) for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes:
- A point of contact specific to your agency in the RUA field.
- <reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov> as one of the emails in the RUA field.
- One or more agency-defined points of contact in the RUF field.

## 5. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Authentication

Modern email clients that connect to Exchange Online mailboxes—including
Outlook, Outlook on the web, iOS Mail, and Outlook for iOS and
Android—do not use Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Authentication (SMTP
AUTH) to send email messages. SMTP AUTH is only needed for applications
outside of Outlook that send email messages. Multi-factor authentication
(MFA) cannot be enforced while using SMTP Auth. Proceed with caution if
SMTP Auth needs to be enabled for any use case.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.5.1v1
SMTP AUTH SHALL be disabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.5.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ SMTP AUTH is not used or needed by modern email clients.
Therefore, disabling it as the global default conforms to the principle of
least functionality.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping:_
  - None

### Resources

- [Enable or disable authenticated client SMTP submission (SMTP AUTH) in

1. Sign in to the **Exchange admin center**.

2. On the left hand pane, select **Settings**; then from the settings list, select **Mail Flow**.

3. Make sure the setting **Turn off SMTP AUTH protocol for your organization** is checked.

## 6. Calendar and Contact Sharing

Exchange Online allows creation of sharing polices that soften default restrictions on contact and calendar details sharing. These policies should be enabled with caution and only after considering the following policies.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.6.1v1
Contact folders SHALL NOT be shared with all domains.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.6.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Contact folders may contain information that should not be shared by default with all domains. Disabling sharing with all domains closes an avenue for data exfiltration while still allowing
for specific legitimate use as needed.

#### MS.EXO.6.2v1 Instructions

To restrict sharing calendar details with all domains:

1. Refer to step 5 in [MS.EXO.6.1v1 Instructions](#msexo61v1-instructions) to implement
this policy.

## 7. External Sender Warnings

Mail flow rules allow incoming email modification, such that email from external users can be easily identified (e.g., by prepending the subject line with "\[External\]").

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.7.1v1
External sender warnings SHALL be implemented.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.7.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Phishing is an ever-present threat. Alerting users when email originates from outside their organization can encourage them to exercise increased caution, especially if an email is one they expected from an internal sender.

15. The new rule will be disabled.  Re-select the new rule to show its
    settings and slide the **Enable or disable rule** slider to the right
    until it shows as **Enabled**.

## 8. Data Loss Prevention Solutions

Data loss prevention (DLP) helps prevent both accidental leakage of
sensitive information as well as intentional exfiltration of data. DLP
forms an integral part of securing Microsoft Exchange Online. There are
several commercial DLP solutions available that document support for
M365. Microsoft itself offer DLP services, controlled within the Microsoft Purview
compliance portal. Agencies may select any service that fits their needs and meets
the requirements outlined in this baseline setting. The DLP solution selected by an agency
should offer services comparable to those offered by Microsoft.

Though use of Microsoft's DLP solution is not strictly
required, guidance for configuring Microsoft's DLP solution can be found in the following section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

## 9. Attachment File Type

For some types of files (e.g., executable files), the dangers of
allowing them to be sent via email outweigh any potential benefits.
Some services, such as the Common Attachment Filter of Microsoft
Defender, filter emails based on the attachment file types. Using
Microsoft Defender for this purpose is not required. However,
the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to
those offered by Microsoft.

Though using Microsoft Defender's solution is not strictly required for
this purpose, guidance for configuring the Common Attachment Filter in
Microsoft Defender can be found in the follow section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

- [Preset Security Policies \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#1-preset-security-profiles)

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.9.1v2
Emails SHALL be filtered by attachment file types.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.9.1v2; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Malicious attachments often take the form of click-to-run files.
Sharing high risk file types, when necessary, is better left to a means other
than email; the dangers of allowing them to be sent over email outweigh
any potential benefits. Filtering email attachments based on file types can
prevent spread of malware distributed via click-to-run email attachments.

## 10. Malware Scanning

Email messages may include attachments that contain malware. Therefore, email
messages should be scanned for malware to prevent infections. Once malware has
been identified, the scanner should drop or quarantine the associated messages.
Because malware detections may be updated, it is also important that emails
that were already delivered to users are also scanned and removed.

Using Microsoft Defender for this purpose is not required. However,
the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to
those offered by Microsoft. If the agency uses Microsoft Defender to
implement malware scanning, see the following policies of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365 for additional guidance.

- [MS.DEFENDER.1.2v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#msdefender12v1)

## 11. Phishing Protections

Several techniques exist for protecting against phishing attacks,
including the following:

- Impersonation protection checks, wherein a tool compares the sender's
  address to the addresses of known senders to flag look-alike
  addresses, such as `user@exmple.com` and `user@example.com`.

- User warnings, such as displaying a notice the first time a user
  receives an email from a new sender.

- Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools.

Any product meeting the requirements outlined in this baseline
policy group may be used. If the agency uses Exchange Online Protection
(EOP), which is included in all Microsoft 365 subscriptions containing
Exchange Online mailboxes, see the following policy and section of the CISA
M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

- [MS.DEFENDER.1.2v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#msdefender12v1).
  - All users SHALL be added to Exchange Online Protection in either the standard or strict preset security policy.

EOP alone does not support impersonation protection, but this is provided through
Defender for Office 365. If using Defender for Office 365 for impersonation protection, see the following policy and section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

- [Impersonation Protection \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#2-impersonation-protection)

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.11.1v1
Impersonation protection checks SHOULD be used.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.11.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Users might not be able to reliably identify phishing emails, especially
if the `FROM` address is nearly indistinguishable from that of a known entity.
By automatically identifying senders who appear to be impersonating known
senders, the risk of a successful phishing attempt can be reduced.

#### MS.EXO.11.2v1
User warnings, comparable to the user safety tips included with EOP, SHOULD be displayed.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.11.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Many tasks are better suited for automated processes, such as identifying
unusual characters in the `FROM` address or identifying a first-time sender.
User warnings can handle these tasks, reducing the burden on end users and the risk of
successful phishing attempts.

## 12. IP Allow Lists

Microsoft Defender supports creating IP allow lists intended
to prevent blocking emails from *specific* senders. However,
as a result, emails from these senders bypass important security
mechanisms, such as spam filtering, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and [FROM address
enforcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-from-email-address-validation?view=o365-worldwide#override-from-address-enforcement).

IP block lists block email from listed IP addresses. Although we have no specific guidance on which IP addresses to add, block lists can be used to block mail from known spammers.

IP safe lists are dynamic lists of "known, good senders," which Microsoft sources from various third-party subscriptions. As with senders in the allow list, emails from these senders bypass important security mechanisms.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.12.1v1
IP allow lists SHOULD NOT be created.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.12.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Messages sent from IP addresses on an allow list bypass important
security mechanisms, including spam filtering and sender authentication checks.  Avoiding use of IP allow lists prevents potential threats from circumventing security mechanisms.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping:_
  - None

#### MS.EXO.12.2v1
Safe lists SHOULD NOT be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.12.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Messages sent from allowed safe list addresses bypass important
security mechanisms, including spam filtering and sender authentication checks.
Avoiding use of safe lists prevents potential threats from circumventing
security mechanisms. While blocking all malicious senders is not feasible,
blocking specific known, malicious IP addresses may reduce the threat from
specific senders.

## 13. Mailbox Auditing

Mailbox auditing helps users investigate compromised accounts or
discover illicit access to Exchange Online. As a feature of Exchange
Online, mailbox auditing is enabled by default for all organizations.
Microsoft defines a default audit policy that logs certain actions
performed by administrators, delegates, and owners. While mailbox auditing is enabled by default,
this policy helps avoid inadvertent disabling.
### Policies

## 14. Inbound Anti-Spam Protections

Junk email, or spam, can clutter user mailboxes and hamper communications
across an agency. Implementing a spam filter helps to identify inbound spam and
quarantine or move those messages. Microsoft Defender includes several
capabilities for protecting against inbound spam emails. Using Microsoft
Defender is not strictly required for this purpose; any product that
fulfills the requirements outlined in this baseline policy group may be
used. If the agency uses Microsoft Defender to meet this baseline policy
group, see the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration
Baseline for Defender for Office 365.

- [MS.DEFENDER.1.2v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#msdefender12v1)

Allowed domains SHALL NOT be added to inbound anti-spam protection policies.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.14.3v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Legitimate emails may be incorrectly filtered
by spam protections. Adding allowed senders is an acceptable method of
combating these false positives. Allowing an entire domain, especially
a common domain like office.com, however, provides for a large number of
potentially unknown users to bypass spam protections.

If a third-party party filtering solution is used, the solution SHOULD offer services comparable to the native spam filtering offered by Microsoft.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.14.4v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Spam is a constant threat as junk mail can reduce user productivity, fill up mailboxes unnecessarily, and in some cases include malicious links or attachments.

## 15. Link Protection

Several technologies exist for protecting users from malicious links
included in emails. For example, Microsoft Defender accomplishes this by
prepending:

`https://*.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=`

to any URLs included in emails. By prepending the safe links URL,
Microsoft can proxy the initial URL through their scanning service.
Their proxy can perform the following actions:

- Compare the URL with a block list.

- Compare the URL with a list of know malicious sites.

- If the URL points to a downloadable file, apply real-time file
  scanning.

If all checks pass, the user is redirected to the original URL.

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes link scanning capabilities.
Using Microsoft Defender is not strictly required for this purpose;
any product fulfilling the requirements outlined in this baseline policy group may be used.
If the agency uses Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to meet this baseline policy group, see the following policy of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365 for additional guidance.

- [MS.DEFENDER.1.3v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#msdefender13v1).
  - All users SHALL be added to Defender for Office 365 Protection in either the standard or strict preset security policy.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.15.1v1
URL comparison with a block-list SHOULD be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.15.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->

## 16. Alerts

Managing and monitoring Exchange mailboxes and user activity requires a means
to define activity of concern and notify administrators.  Alerts can be
generated to help identify suspicious or malicious activity in Exchange Online.
These alerts give administrators better real-time insight into possible
security incidents.

Using Microsoft 365 alert policies is not strictly required for this purpose;
any product fulfilling the requirements outlined in this baseline policy
group may be used. If the agency uses Microsoft 365 alert policies, this
includes several prebuilt alert policies, many of which pertain to Exchange
Online. Guidance for configuring alerts in Microsoft 365 is
given in the following section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline
for Defender for Office 365.

- [Alerts \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#5-alerts)

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.16.1v1
At a minimum, the following alerts SHALL be enabled:

  a. **Suspicious email sending patterns detected.**

  b. **Suspicious Connector Activity.**

  c. **Suspicious Email Forwarding Activity.**

  d. **Messages have been delayed.**

  e. **Tenant restricted from sending unprovisioned email.**

  f. **Tenant restricted from sending email.**

  g. **A potentially malicious URL click was detected.**

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.16.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Potentially malicious or service impacting events may go
  undetected without a means of detecting these events. Setting up a mechanism
  to alert administrators to events listed above draws attention to them
  to help minimize impact to users and the agency.

#### MS.EXO.16.2v1
The alerts SHOULD be sent to a monitored address or incorporated into a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.16.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Suspicious or malicious events, if not resolved promptly, may
  have a greater impact to users and the agency. Sending alerts to a
  monitored email address or SIEM system helps ensure these suspicious or
  malicious events are acted upon in a timely manner to limit overall
  impact.

## 17. Audit Logging

User activity from M365 services is captured in the organization's unified
audit log. These logs are essential for conducting incident response and
threat detection activity.

By default, Microsoft retains the audit logs for 180 days. Activity by
users with E5 licenses assigned is retained for one year.

However, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum 21-31, _Improving the Federal Government's
Investigative and Remediation Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents_,
Microsoft 365 audit logs are to be retained at least 12 months in active
storage and an additional 18 months in cold storage. This can be accomplished
by offloading the logs out of the cloud environment or natively through
Microsoft by creating an [audit log retention
policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy).

OMB M-21-31 also requires Advanced Audit be configured in M365. Advanced Audit,
now Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium), adds additional event types to the
Unified Audit Log.

Audit logging is managed from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. For
implementation guidance for configuring audit logging, see the following
section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for
Office 365.

- [Audit Logging \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender for Office 365](./defender.md#6-audit-logging)

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.17.1v1
Unified Audit logging SHALL be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.17.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Responding to incidents without detailed information about activities that took place slows response actions. Enabling Unified Audit logging helps ensure agencies have visibility into user actions. Furthermore, enabling the Unified Audit log is required for government agencies by OMB M-21-31.

#### MS.EXO.17.2v1
Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) logging SHALL be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.17.2v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Standard logging may not include relevant details necessary for
visibility into user actions during an incident. Enabling Microsoft Purview Audit
(Premium) captures additional event types not included with Standard.
Furthermore, it is required for government agencies by OMB M-21-31 (referred to therein by its former name, Unified Audit Logs w/Advanced Features).
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_ At the time of this writing, Microsoft has announced upcoming changes
          to its Purview Audit service that include making audit events
          currently available in Purview Audit (Premium) available to Purview
          Audit (Standard) subscribers. After rollout of changes are complete,
          Purview (Standard) may be sufficient for agencies to meet basic
          logging requirements.

    - [T1562.008: Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008/)

#### MS.EXO.17.3v1
Audit logs SHALL be maintained for at least the minimum duration dictated by OMB M-21-31 (Appendix C).

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.17.3v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Audit logs may no longer be available when needed if they
are not retained for a sufficient time.  Increased log retention time
gives an agency the necessary visibility to investigate incidents that occurred
some time ago. OMB M-21-13, Appendix C, Table 5 specifically calls out Unified
Audit Logs in the Cloud Azure log category.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note_: Microsoft 365 Purview (Premium) provides a default audit log retention policy,
          retaining Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for
          Business, and Microsoft Entra ID audit records for one year.
          Additional record types require custom audit retention policies.
          Agencies may also consider alternate storage locations and services
          to meet audit log retention needs.

### License Requirements

- Microsoft 365 Audit (Premium) capabilities, including the creation of a custom audit
  log retention policy, requires E5/G5 licenses or E3/G3 licenses with
  add-on compliance licenses.

- Additionally, maintaining logs in the M365 environment for longer than one
  year requires an add-on license. For more information, see
  [Licensing requirements \| Microsoft
  Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/auditing-solutions-overview?view=o365-worldwide#licensing-requirements). However, this requirement can also be met by exporting the logs from M365 and storing them with your solution of choice, in which case audit log retention policies are not necessary.
