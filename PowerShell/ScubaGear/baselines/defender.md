# CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Defender

Microsoft 365 (M365) Defender is a cloud-based enterprise defense suite that coordinates prevention, detection, investigation, and response. This set of tools and features are used to detect many types of attacks.

This baseline focuses on the features of Defender for Office 365, but some settings are actually configured in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. However, for simplicity, both the M365 Defender and Microsoft Purview compliance portal items are contained in this baseline.

Generally, use of Microsoft Defender is not required by the baselines of the core M365 products (Exchange Online, Teams, etc.). Should an agency elect to use Defender as their tool of choice, agencies should apply these baseline settings. Please note that some of the controls in the core baselines require the use of a dedicated security tool that provides comparable protection as Defender.   In addition to applying these controls, agencies should consider using a cloud access security broker to secure their environments as they adopt zero trust principles.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies’ cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for M365 help secure federal information assets stored within M365 cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government’s threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. While use of these baselines will be mandatory for civilian Federal Government agencies, organizations outside of the Federal Government may also find these baselines to be useful references to help reduce risks.

For non-Federal users, the information in this document is being provided “as is” for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CISA does not endorse any commercial product or service, including any subjects of analysis. Any reference to specific commercial entities or commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoritism by CISA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, some controls and settings are not available in all products; CISA has no control over vendor changes to products offerings or features.  Accordingly, these SCuBA SCBs for M365 may not be applicable to the products available to you.

## Assumptions
The agency has identified a set of user accounts that are considered sensitive accounts. See [Key Terminology](#key-terminology) for a detailed description of sensitive accounts.

The **License Requirements** sections of this document assume the organization is using an [M365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans) or [G3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/government) license level at a minimum. Therefore, only licenses not included in E3/G3 are listed.

## Key Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

The following are key terms and descriptions used in this document.

**Sensitive Accounts**: This term denotes a set of user accounts that have
access to sensitive and high-value information. As a result, these accounts
may be at a higher risk of being targeted.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Preset Security Profiles

Microsoft Defender defines three [preset security
profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide):
built-in protection, standard, and strict. These preset policies are informed by Microsoft's observations, and are designed to strike the balance between usability and security. They allow administrators to enable the full feature set of Defender by simply adding users to the policies rather than manually configuring each setting.

Within the standard and strict preset policies, users can be enrolled in [Exchange Online Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/eop-about?view=o365-worldwide) (EOP) and [Defender for Office 365 protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview?view=o365-worldwide). Additionally, preset policies support configuration of [impersonation protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/anti-phishing-policies-about?view=o365-worldwide#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

## 2. Impersonation Protection
Impersonation protection checks incoming emails to see if the sender
address is similar to the users or domains on an agency-defined list. If
the sender address is significantly similar, as to indicate an
impersonation attempt, the email is quarantined.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.2.1v1
User impersonation protection SHOULD be enabled for sensitive accounts in both the standard and strict preset policies.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.2.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ User impersonation, especially of users with access to sensitive or high-value information and resources, has the potential to result in serious harm. Impersonation protection mitigates this risk. By configuring impersonation protection in both preset policies, administrators can help protect email recipients from impersonated emails, regardless of whether they are added to the standard or strict policy.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_ The standard and strict preset security policies must be enabled to

  - [T1656: Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656/)

#### MS.DEFENDER.2.2v1
Domain impersonation protection SHOULD be enabled for domains owned by the agency in both the standard and strict preset policies.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.2.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Configuring domain impersonation protection for all agency domains reduces the risk of a user being deceived by a look-alike domain. By configuring impersonation protection in both preset policies, administrators can help protect email recipients from impersonated emails, regardless of whether they are added to the standard or strict policy.

#### MS.DEFENDER.2.3v1
Domain impersonation protection SHOULD be added for important partners in both the standard and strict preset policies.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.2.3v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Configuring domain impersonation protection for domains owned by important partners reduces the risk of a user being deceived by a look-alike domain.

## 3. Safe Attachments

The Safe Attachments feature will scan messages for attachments with malicious
content. All messages with attachments not already flagged by anti-malware
protections in EOP are downloaded to a Microsoft virtual environment for
further analysis. Safe Attachments then uses machine learning and other
analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. While Safe Attachments for
Exchange Online is automatically configured in the preset policies, separate
action is needed to enable it for other products.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.3.1v1
Safe attachments SHOULD be enabled for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.3.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Clicking malicious links makes users vulnerable to attacks, and this danger is not limited to links in emails. Other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Teams, can be used to present users with malicious links. As such, it is important to protect users on these other Microsoft products as well.

## 4. Data Loss Prevention

There are several approaches to securing sensitive information, such
as warning users, encryption, or blocking attempts to share. Agency
policies for sensitive information, such as personally identifiable
information (PII), should dictate how that information is handled and
inform associated data loss prevention (DLP) policies. Defender can detect
sensitive information and associates a default confidence level with
this detection based on the sensitive information type matched.
Confidence levels are used to reduce false positives in detecting access
to sensitive information. Agencies may choose to use the default
confidence levels or adjust the levels in custom DLP policies to fit
their environment and needs.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.4.1v2
A custom policy SHALL be configured to protect PII and sensitive information, as defined by the agency, blocking at a minimum: credit card numbers, U.S. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), and U.S. Social Security numbers (SSN).

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.1v2; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Users may inadvertently share sensitive information with
               others who should not have access to it. DLP policies
               provide a way for agencies to detect and prevent
               unauthorized disclosures.

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.2v1
The custom policy SHOULD be applied to Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams chat, and Devices.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Unauthorized disclosures may happen through M365 services
               or endpoint devices. DLP policies should cover all
               affected locations to be effective.

    - [T1213.002: Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002/)

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.3v1
The action for the custom policy SHOULD be set to block sharing sensitive information with everyone.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.3v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Access to sensitive information should be prohibited unless
               explicitly allowed. Specific exemptions can be made based
               on agency policies and valid business justifications.

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.4v1
Notifications to inform users and help educate them on the proper use of sensitive information SHOULD be enabled in the custom policy.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.4v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some users may not be aware of agency policies on
               proper use of sensitive information. Enabling
               notifications provides positive feedback to users when
               accessing sensitive information.

- _MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping:_
  - None

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.5v1
A list of apps that are restricted from accessing files protected by DLP policy SHOULD be defined.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.5v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some apps may inappropriately share accessed files or not
               conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information. Defining a list of those apps makes it
               possible to use DLP policies to restrict those apps' access
               to sensitive information on endpoints using Defender.

#### MS.DEFENDER.4.6v1
The custom policy SHOULD include an action to block access to sensitive
information by restricted apps and unwanted Bluetooth applications.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.4.6v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Some apps may inappropriately share accessed files
               or not conform to agency policies for access to sensitive
               information. Defining a DLP policy with an action to block
               access from restricted apps and unwanted Bluetooth
               applications prevents unauthorized disclosure by those
               programs.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note:_
  - The custom policy referenced here is the same policy
    configured in [MS.DEFENDER.4.1v2](#msdefender41v2).
  - This action can only be included if at least one device is onboarded
    to the agency tenant. Otherwise, the option to block restricted apps will
    not be available.

## 5. Alerts

There are several pre-built alert policies available pertaining to
various apps in the M365 suite. These alerts give administrators better
real-time insight into possible security incidents. Guidance on specific alerts to configure can be found in the linked section of the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Exchange Online.

- [MS.EXO.16.1v1 \| CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Exchange Online](./exo.md#msexo161v1)

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.5.1v1
At a minimum, the alerts required by the CISA M365 Secure Configuration Baseline for Exchange Online SHALL be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.5.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Potentially malicious or service-impacting events may go undetected without a means of detecting these events. Setting up a mechanism to alert administrators to the list of events linked above draws attention to them to minimize any impact to users and the agency.

    - [T1562.006: Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006/)

#### MS.DEFENDER.5.2v1
The alerts SHOULD be sent to a monitored address or incorporated into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.5.2v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ Suspicious or malicious events, if not resolved promptly, may have a greater impact to users and the agency. Sending alerts to a monitored email address or SIEM system helps ensure events are acted upon in a timely manner to limit overall impact.

## 6. Audit Logging

User activity from M365 services is captured in the organization's unified
audit log. These logs are essential for conducting incident response and
threat detection activity.

By default, Microsoft retains the audit logs for 180 days. Activity
by users with E5 licenses is logged for one year.

However, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum
21-31, _Improving the Federal Government's Investigative and Remediation
Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents_, M365 audit logs are to be
retained for at least 12 months in active storage and an additional 18 months
in cold storage. This can be accomplished either by offloading the logs out of
the cloud environment or natively through Microsoft by creating an [audit log
retention policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy).

OMB M-21-13 requires Advanced Audit Features be configured in M365.
Advanced Audit, now Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium), adds additional event
types to the Unified Audit Log.

### Policies
#### MS.DEFENDER.6.1v1
Unified Audit logging SHALL be enabled.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.6.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Responding to incidents without detailed information about activities that took place slows response actions. Enabling Unified Audit logging helps ensure agencies have visibility into user actions. Furthermore, enabling the Unified Audit log is required for government agencies by OMB M-21-31.

    - [T1562.008: Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008/)

#### MS.DEFENDER.6.3v1
Audit logs SHALL be maintained for at least the minimum duration dictated by OMB M-21-31.

<!--Policy: MS.DEFENDER.6.3v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ Audit logs may no longer be available when needed if they are not retained for a sufficient time. Increased log retention time gives an agency the necessary visibility to investigate incidents that occurred some time ago.
- _Last modified:_ June 2023
- _Note_: Purview Audit (Premium) provides a default audit log retention policy,
          retaining Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for
          Business, and Microsoft Entra ID audit records for one year.
          Additional record types require custom audit retention policies.
          Agencies may also consider alternate storage locations and services
          to meet audit log retention needs.

### License Requirements

- Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) logging capabilities, including the creation of a custom audit
  log retention policy, requires E5/G5 licenses or E3/G3 licenses with
  add-on compliance licenses.

- Additionally, maintaining logs in the M365 environment for longer than
  one year requires an add-on license. For more information, see
  [Manage audit log retention policies | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?tabs=microsoft-purview-portal#before-you-create-an-audit-log-retention-policy). However, this requirement can also be met by exporting the logs from M365 and storing them with your solution of choice, in which case audit log retention policies are not necessary.

### Implementation

#### MS.DEFENDER.6.1v1 Instructions

To enable auditing via the Microsoft Purview compliance portal:

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Purview compliance portal**.

2. Under **Solutions**, select **Audit**.

3. If auditing is not enabled, a banner is displayed to notify the
administrator to start recording user and admin activity.

4. Click the **Start recording user and admin activity**.

#### MS.DEFENDER.6.3v1 Instructions
To create one or more custom audit retention policies, if the default retention policy is not sufficient for agency needs, follow [Create an audit log retention policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy) instructions.
Ensure the duration selected in the retention policies is at least one year, in accordance with OMB M-21-31. 

As noted in the [License Requirements](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/baselines/defender.md#license-requirements-1) section above, the creation of a custom audit log retention policy and its retention in the M365 environment requires E5/G5 licenses or E3/G3 licenses with add-on compliance licenses. No additional license is required to view and export logs. To view and export audit logs follow [Export, configure, and view audit log records | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-export-records) and/or [Untitled Goose Tool Fact Sheet | CISA.](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/untitled-goose-tool-fact-sheet)
