ScubaGear is an assessment tool that verifies that a Microsoft 365 (M365) tenantâ€™s configuration conforms to the policies described in the Secure Cloud Business Applications ([SCuBA](https://cisa.gov/scuba)) Secure Configuration Baseline [documents](/baselines/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation can be read using [GitHub Pages](https://cisagov.github.io/ScubaGear).

## Target Audience

ScubaGear is for M365 administrators who want to assess their tenant environments against CISA Secure Configuration Baselines.

## What's New

**Scuba Configuration UI**: SCuBA now includes a graphical user interface that makes it easier than ever to create and manage your YAML configuration files. This intuitive tool helps reduce the complexity of manual editing and streamlines the configuration process for your organization.

#### UI Key Features:
- Launch with `Start-ScubaConfigApp`
- Step-by-step setup wizard covering all configuration options
- Real-time validation with live YAML preview
- Microsoft Graph integration for user and group selection
- Seamless import/export of existing configuration files

> Ideal for users who prefer a visual interface over command-line tools.

## Overview

ScubaGear uses a three-step process:

- **Step One** - PowerShell code queries M365 APIs for various configuration settings.
- **Step Two** - It then calls [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to compare these settings against Rego security policies written per the baseline documents.
- **Step Three** - Finally, it reports the results of the comparison as HTML, JSON, and CSV.

## Key Features

### Baseline Security Coverage

SCuBA controls have been [mapped](docs/misc/mappings.md) to both NIST SP 800-53 and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

  - [Baselines](baselines/README.md)
    - [Microsoft Entra ID](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/aad.md): Identity and access management policies
    - [Defender](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/defender.md): Advanced threat protection settings
    - [Exchange Online](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/exo.md): Email security and compliance configurations
    - [Power BI](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/powerbi.md): Cloud-based data visualization tool security settings
    - [Power Platform](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/powerplatform.md): Low-code application security settings
    - [SharePoint](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/sharepoint.md): Document collaboration and access controls
    - [Teams](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/teams.md): Communication and meeting security policies

  - [Removed Policies](PowerShell/ScubaGear/baselines/removedpolicies.md)

### ScubaGear Output

- **HTML Reports**: Interactive, user-friendly compliance reports. See SAMPLE: [Baselinereports.html](PowerShell/ScubaGear/Sample-Reports/BaselineReports.html)
- **JSON Output**: Structured results for reporting and parsing. See SAMPLE: [ScubaResults.json](PowerShell/ScubaGear/Sample-Reports/ScubaResults_0d275954-350e-4a22.json)
- **CSV Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible data for analysis. See SAMPLE: [ScubaResults.csv](PowerShell/ScubaGear/Sample-Reports/ScubaResults.csv)

## Getting Started

Before launching **ScubaGear**, it's important to ensure your environment is properly configured. This includes having the necessary dependencies and permissions in place.

Please review the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section to verify that your system meets all requirements. This will help avoid errors during execution and ensure a smooth experience when using ScubaGear.


### Quick Start Guide

ScubaGear can be run multiple times to properly evaluate baseline settings.

1. **First Run (No Configuration File):**
   Start ScubaGear without a configuration file. This initial run generates a baseline template of your environment's current settings. It does not make changes but helps you understand the default posture.

2. **Subsequent Runs (With Configuration File):**
   After reviewing and editing the generated configuration file, run ScubaGear again with the configuration file as input. This allows ScubaGear to compare your intended settings against the actual environment and elevate discrepancies accordingly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ScubaGear has specific prerequisites and relies on defined configuration values to properly evaluate your Microsoft 365 tenant. After your initial assessment run, review the results thoroughly. Address any identified gaps by updating your tenant configuration or documenting risk acceptances in a YAML configuration file using exclusions, annotations, or omissions.
> **Refer to the sections below for detailed guidance.**


This iterative approach ensures ScubaGear is aligned with your environment and that all policy evaluations are based on your customized baseline.

### 1. Install ScubaGear

Before launching **ScubaGear**, it's important to ensure your environment is properly prepared. This includes having the necessary configurations, permissions, and platform dependencies in place.

Please review the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section to verify that your system meets all requirements. This will help avoid errors during execution and ensure a smooth experience when using ScubaGear.


### Quick Start Guide

ScubaGear is designed to be run multiple times to properly evaluate and apply baseline settings.

1. **First Run (No Configuration File):**
   Start ScubaGear without a configuration file. This initial run generates a baseline template of your environment's current settings. It does not make changes but helps you understand the default posture.

2. **Subsequent Runs (With Configuration File):**
   After reviewing and editing the generated configuration file, run ScubaGear again with the configuration file as input. This allows ScubaGear to compare your intended settings against the actual environment and elevate discrepancies accordingly.

This iterative approach ensures ScubaGear is aligned with your environment and that all policy evaluations are based on your customized baseline.
