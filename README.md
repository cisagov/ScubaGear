ScubaGear is an assessment tool that verifies that a Microsoft 365 (M365) tenantâ€™s configuration conforms to the policies described in the Secure Cloud Business Applications ([SCuBA](https://cisa.gov/scuba)) Secure Configuration Baseline [documents](/baselines/README.md).

> **Note**: This documentation can be read using [GitHub Pages](https://cisagov.github.io/ScubaGear).

## Target Audience

ScubaGear is for M365 administrators who want to assess their tenant environments against CISA Secure Configuration Baselines.

## Overview

ScubaGear uses a three-step process:

- **Step One** - PowerShell code queries M365 APIs for various configuration settings.
- **Step Two** - It then calls [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to compare these settings against Rego security policies written per the baseline documents.
- **Step Three** - Finally, it reports the results of the comparison as HTML, JSON, and CSV.
